						Reverse polish notation is an alternative way of writing equations. In standard notation, you may have the expression (5+3)*2.
						This cannot be written without the use of parentheses. In reverse polish notation, numbers are added to a stack, and then "popped" off of the stack when an operation is performed.
						The example equation could be written in reverse polish notation as "2 3 5 + *". This may seem confusing at first, but it can lead to speedy entry of complicated equations.

						To enter a number, just type the numbers anywhere. Use the n key for negative values.
						To push it on the stack (that is, to put it at the beginning), either press the enter key, or tap the green arrow button.
						To pop a number off of the stack (that is, to remove it from the beginning), tap the red arrow button. It will be put into the input field.
						To perform an operation, tap the operation's button.  The result will then be pushed onto the stack.
						Many operations use two values, so they will pop two values off of the stack.

						the calculator will "play back" the actions that you took while recording. This can be saved for use later by choosing "save

						A stack is a data structure which holds a number of values. These values are put on to the stack by being "pushed", and removed
						from the stack by being "popped." Popping a value off of the stack returns its value. When you push a sequence of values onto 
						the stack, they will be popped in reverse order (A stack is a first in, last out data structure.) 
						For example, pushing "3", "5", and "8" will yield the stack "8, 5, 3", as the values are placed on the top of the stack as
						they are added. If you would like to read more about stacks, there is a good article on the wikipedia, although it may be
						a little too technical for some.
